# IBM-Machine-Learning-with-Python
This notebook belongs to the IBM Machine Learning with Python Course provided by Coursera. However this project was not mandatory to complete the course, but an honors content.
There are some extra lines of code added into the notebook so that it looks better and more understable.
Happy Coding.
